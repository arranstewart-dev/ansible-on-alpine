An alpine-based install of [ansible][ansible-pypi]
(plus the [molecule][molecule-pypi] testing framework).

[ansible-pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/ansible/
[molecule-pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/molecule/

Won't do anything fancy with virtualbox or libvirt etc, but handy
if you just want to run a playbook.

Image size is approx. 430MB.
